        Your code sample should be:
        1. Minimal - Use as little code as possible that still produces the same problem (and is understandable)
        2. Complete - Provide all parts someone else needs to reproduce your problem
        3. Reproducible - Test the code you're about to provide to make sure it reproduces the problem

        This will be automatically formatted into code, so no need for backticks.
